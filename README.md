- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Varshini Elangovan 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Learning new things[which include new tools, programming language, cooking and everything around me] and systems engineer knowledge [Linux] .
- This github basically contains my learnings. Suddenly thought to document in the place which can be seen by others as well so ended by here.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on Linked-In https://www.linkedin.com/in/varshini-elangovan/
